## Abstract
We would like to predict how vulnerable a person is to several most common deadly diseases including lung cancer, large intestine cancer etc. and present the result on a webapp. To achieve this objective, we would first collect large data sets of the listed diseases’ patients. Then, we would use machine learning to identify the top ten relevant factors contributing to a certain disease such as the frequency of smoking cigarettes and the sleeping schedules. Finally, a “risk index” will be calculated for each user.
